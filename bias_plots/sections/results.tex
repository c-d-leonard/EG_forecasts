A cross-correlation measurement between DESI-like LRGs selected from DECaLS imaging and CMB lensing from Planck 2018 is detected at a significance of S/N $= 27.2$ over the range of scales $\ell_{\rm min}=30$ to $\ell_{\rm max}=1000$. In Figure~\ref{fig:snr}, we plot per-multipole and cumulative signal-to-noise ratios for both the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-convergence spectra, where the signal-to-noise ratio of the $XY$ angular power spectrum at multipole $\ell$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    {\bigg (} \frac{S}{N}{\bigg )}(\ell) = \frac{C_{\ell}^{\rm XY}}{\sigma_{\ell}^{\rm XY}}
\end{equation}
and the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to $\ell_{\rm max}$ is
\begin{equation}
    {\bigg (} \frac{S}{N}{\bigg )}(< \ell_{\rm max}) = \sqrt{\sum_{\ell^{\prime}=\ell_{\rm min}}^{\ell_{\rm max}}\frac{(C_{\ell^{\prime}}^{\rm XY})^2}{(\sigma_{\ell^{\prime}}^{\rm XY})^2}}
\end{equation}
The galaxy-galaxy S/N peaks at $\ell \sim 500$ whereas the galaxy-convergence generally decreases over the range of scales considered. We note that the theoretical galaxy-convergence S/N would be expected to peak at $\ell \sim 100$ and fall off at smaller $\ell$; as this is within the regime at which both the pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ framework and the Limber approximation begin to break down, this feature is washed out in the observed S/N.

We also compare the cross-spectrum using the baseline MV CMB lensing map versus using the TT-only tSZ-deprojected map. The two curves are shown in the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:basevdeproj}, and clearly lie well within $1\sigma$ of one another. The fractional difference is shown in the lower panel. Since the error bars on the cross-spectra are generally large, they dominate the errors on the fraction, but as Figure~\ref{fig:basevdeproj} illustrates, the errors associated with tSZ are on the order of a few percent and very subdominant to the overall lensing noise.

In the following sub-sections, we present the angular power spectra and interpret them using two different models for the galaxy-galaxy and matter-galaxy 3D power spectra: the HaloFit dark matter power spectrum multiplied by a linear large-scale bias, and a convolutional Lagrangian effective field theory with Lagrangian bias. Additionally, we perform the fits using both photometric- and clustering-derived redshift distributions for the galaxy sample, which not only suggests an estimate of the error associated with uncertainty in the redshift distribution, but also allows us to evaluate the bias at an effective redshift $z \approx 0.68$ in both models and to test the assumption of passive bias evolution.

\subsection{Bandpower covariance}\label{sec:results/discussion}

In order to evaluate whether correlated bandpower bins contribute to low reduced chi-square in the fits, we repeat the full analysis using bandpower bins of $\Delta \ell = 100$ instead of 20. The recovered bias parameters remain the same, and the reduced chi-square of the fits do not appreciably change. Since $\chi^2$ / d.o.f.\ should be preserved under changes in binning scheme if the bins are uncorrelated, we consider this sufficient evidence that our bins of $\Delta \ell = 20$ are largely uncorrelated. As another test, we also performed the fits using $\ell_{\rm min} = 100$ instead of $\ell_{\rm min} = 30$ and again found that the results and goodness-of-fit remained stable suggesting that large scales are not driving our fitting results.
